Gonk is a Discord bot that was created in Node with discord.js.

It uses the Bricklink API in order to show users in a server what the Lego item is depending on the users set number query. It is inspired by the reddit LegoLinkBot and is now live on a server with 250 users. 

So far the main command for Gonk is: !set {setnumber}
The bot will respond with the sets name, image and year of release.

Secondary command is: !usage
The bot will respond with the number of times the API has been queried.
